<h1>China’s Plastics Boom, Recycling Ban Upend World Recycling System</h1>

<h2>By Sarah Talaat</h2>

<p>BEIJING, North China — China is seeing unprecedented domestic growth in the consumption of bottled water and beverages. As China continues developing a taste for the convenience of bottled drinks and subscription water delivery services over boiling non-potable tap water, China’s recycling economy is facing new challenges.</p>

<p>In 2016, Chinese grocery and convenience store sales of bottled water, not including barreled water, reached 42.1 billion liters, an 8 percent increase by volume over 2015, according to a 2017 report by Euromonitor International. Consumers here used over 1.5 billion kilograms of PET for bottled water alone in 2016, which is equivalent to the weight of roughly 87,000 public transportation buses.</p>

<p>With this explosive growth, centers buying domestic and foreign recycling soon began operating around the clock and at maximum capacity.</p>

<p>But it didn’t last for long.</p>

<p>As of January 1 the Chinese government began enforcing a ban on 24 grades of imported solid waste. This ban included plastics such as PET that are used in many beverage bottles and subscription water jugs.</p>

<p>The fallout is already hurting local economies. Chinese recycling manufacturers imported 7.3m metric tons of waste plastics from developed countries in 2016, according to Christine Cole, a research fellow in Architecture, Design and the Built Environment at Nottingham Trent University. This amounts to approximately $2.5 billion in scrap plastic deals between Chinese and foreign companies that were effectively shuttered overnight.</p>

<p>A government official from the Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau, who is not authorized to speak to the press and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the import ban had an immediate effect on the region’s companies that bought foreign recycling. Guangxi, which borders Vietnam and has ports along the South China Sea, is a geographically significant region for imports and exports.</p>

<p><q>After the ban, all of the recycling factories I’m familiar with have closed,</q> the official said in an email. He added that the Guangxi government views the ban as a positive step in emphasizing the importance of managing local recycling systems.</p>

<p>As little as 23% of all plastics was recycled in 2013 in China, according to the most recent data from the National Development and Reform Commission.</p>

<p>Wenjing Lu, an associate professor of solid waste management at Tsinghua University, said that China’s growing consumption was putting a strain on the domestic capacity before the ban went into effect. Lu said factors such as pollution control and image concerns likely also contributed to the government’s decision to halt recycling imports.</p>

<p><q>It’s a capacity issue and pollution issue,</q> Lu said in an interview. <q>China cannot be the dumping site for the whole world for all of time. [Recycling] used to all go to China, but now it is being divided up and going to many smaller countries.</q></p>

<p>Lu expects that China’s ban will push major recycling exporters such as the U.S. and Western Europe to find buyers from countries such as India and Indonesia, but those markets will have significantly less capacity.</p>
